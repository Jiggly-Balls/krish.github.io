      <p class="justified-para">
        Around the time I began my degree, a group of friends and I decided to
        build a service for the popular social media platform Discord. Our goal
        was to create bots for various purposes that would enhance the overall
        user experience. We developed bots focused on music, moderation, games,
        and more.
        <br /><br />
        I served as the lead developer for all of our bots, where I introduced
        significant code-quality improvements and performance optimizations.
        Throughout the project, we encountered several challenges and
        roadblocks, but we consistently came up with creative solutions to
        overcome them. One of the most persistent issues we faced was code
        duplication across our bots. Each bot shared the same core features—such
        as help commands, embed systems, cooldown handling, and a common base
        view. Any change to these shared components required manually copying
        updates across every bot, which was both time-consuming and error-prone.
        <br /><br />
        To address this, I proposed extracting these shared systems,
        modularizing them, and packaging them into an open-source library called
        <a href="https://pypi.org/project/disckit/">disckit</a>. We then used
        this library as a dependency across all our bots, effectively solving
        our issues with code duplication and long-term maintainability. Beyond
        addressing our internal needs, the library gained notable traction in
        the community, accumulating over 16k installs. <br /><br />
        After developing and maintaining our bots for over a year, we ultimately
        decided to shut down the service in December 2025. This decision was
        primarily due to team members becoming increasingly occupied with
        academics and personal commitments, myself included. Despite this, the
        experience proved invaluable, and we all emerged from the project as
        significantly stronger developers.
